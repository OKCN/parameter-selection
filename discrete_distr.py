"""Support functions for manipulating discrete probability distributions.

A discrete probability distribution is represented as a dictionary mapping
values in its support to probability masses. Ex: {-1: .5, +1: .5}

A distribution may be defined over Z_q, which affects how the sums and products
are evaluated.
